            <p>
               Hi, Rhiane, I know everything is hard, everything is heavy, everything feels like endless void.
            But I want you to know that I'm always here for you, I want you to feel na you have kakampi
            I want you to feel na may sandalan ka, may iiyakan ka, may tatakbuhan ka sa mga problema mo.
            That's what I want you to feel, cause im doing my best to make feel that way.
            </p>

            <p>
                I want to tell you how proud I am with your academics. Even I can tell na you're not happy w the result
            And I understand u and your feelings are valid. Pero I want you to know na I'm super proud of you 
            Kahit anong kalabasan ng grade mo, I'm proud of you, I've seen your efforts and struggles throughout
            This semester. I'm super duper proud of you, I will and always been proud of you. I hope you find a reason to be proud to yourself!
            </p>

            <p>
                Yes, Lately we're not maayos, lagi tayong nag aaway, and I'm sorry. Madalas pag nag aaway tayo napapangunahan ako ng emosyon
            Nasasabihan kita ng masasakit na salita na hindi ko naman sinasadyang sabihin. I'm really sorry about that.
            Nakikita ko effort mo na ayusin yung relasyon natin, nakikita ko yung sacrifice mo para maging okay tayo.
            I see how much u sacrificed for us to be okay, and I'm willing to do the same.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm sorry for not being a perfect boy friend for you, but I promise you na I'm doing my best to be
                The man you deserve. I'm sorry sa lahat ng pag kukulang ko, sa lahat ng mali ko, I'm sorry.
                I'll always find a way to love you. And always remember 
                "My heart is only yours, even if you devours it"
                "Kalapastangan ang hindi ka ibigin"

            </p>
